# Exploratory Data Analysis For Rollercoaster database

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:

- Perform data cleaning: handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistent entries.

- Conduct descriptive statistics: summarize central tendencies and variability.

- Explore data distributions and relationships using visualizations.

- Prepare the dataset for potential machine learning tasks by identifying patterns and correlations.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries:

1. pandas – data manipulation
2. numpy – numerical operations
3. matplotlib & seaborn – visualizations
4. scipy / statsmodels (if used) – statistical analysis
